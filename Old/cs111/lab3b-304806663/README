lab3b
	This python program reads in a csv file which describes the information inside of a file system. 
	Then the program checks for numerous types of inconsistencies between the block, inode, and directory entry
	information within the csv file. It outputs three types of errors:
		Block Consistency Errors
		I-node Allocation Errors
		Directory Consistency Errors


Makefile:
	This Makefile includes three targets.
	default: does nothing because python doesn't need to be compiled
	dist: creates distribution tarball with above files
	clean: restores to initial untarred version
