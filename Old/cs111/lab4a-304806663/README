see the Edison chip as well as the USB power and USB cables plugged
into the board.

	A screenshot of me cloning my Projects repository into the edison.
Then I cd into the repository and list the one file in the repository, 
README.md. Not shown is how before this, I installed git with opkg.

	A screenshot of me using ssh to enter my Edison over wifi. 
Then I compile hello.c using gcc, and then run the program a.out which 
outputs "Hello World"

	A screenshot of me copying hello.c from ~/transfer/hello.c on my
laptop into ~/Jennie/ on my edison board.
Wifi.png:
	A screenshipt of me setting up my wifi by selecting Alpacament and
then entering the password for it. Then I use ifconfig to list my MAC address
and IP address. Not shown is how, before this, I ran configure_edison --setup
to create a name and password for my edison board.
