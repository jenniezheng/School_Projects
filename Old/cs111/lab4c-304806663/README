===============================CONTENTS===============================
Makefile:
	The makefile has the following targets.
	default: builds lab4c_tls and lab4c_tcp
	clean: rid the directory of everything except the source files, README, and the Makefile.
	dist: creates a tar distribution of the files needed for submission

README:
	Explains the contents of the distribution as well as my experience with the lab.

lab4c.c:
	Main source code file. Includes connect.h and utilizes the connectMe function from that header file.
	Included in both the lab4c_tls and lab4c_tcp programs.

connect.h:
	C Header file which declares the connectMe functon.

connectTSL.c
	C source file which implements the connectMe functon with a TSL connection. 
	Included in only the lab4c_tls program.

connectTCP.c
	C source file which implements the connectMe functon with a TCP connection.
	Included in only the lab4c_tcp program.

===============================PROGRAM===============================
lab4c_tls/lab4c_tcp:
	Each of these programs run on the Intel Edison. It assumes a temperature 
	sensor is attached to A0. It connects to a remote server
	with either TCP (lab4c_tcp) or TLS (lab4c_tls). Using the components, it reports the temperature
	after every period of time. If the button is pressed, the program exits. 
	Furthermore, while the program runs, it is able to read and process a number of 
	commands from the remote server. These commands include SCALE=[C/F] to determine 
	whether it reports in Farenheits or Celcius, PERIOD=[NUMBER OF SECONDS] to determine what interval it reports
	at, STOP to stop the reporting, START to restart the reporting, and OFF to shut the program 
	off. 
	Furthermore, the user can pass arguments into the command line to determine how it starts. 
	The program recognizes the following arguments:
		[PORT_NUMBER] 		required argument to specify the port (18000 for TCP and 19000 for TLS if using default host)
		--host=[SCALE_TYPE]	optional argument to change host from lever.cs.ucla.edu to a custom host
		--id=[SECONDS]		optional argument to change ID from my student ID to a custom ID
		--log=[FILENAME]	optional argument to log temperature reports as well as commands to specified file
