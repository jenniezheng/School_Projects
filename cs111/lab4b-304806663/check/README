Makefile:
	The makefile has the following targets.
	default: builds lab4b
	clean: rid the directory of everything except the source files, README, and the Makefile.
	dist: creates a tar distribution of the files needed for submission
	check: runs a brief smoke check of lab4b

README:
	Explains the contents of the distribution as 
	well as my experience with the lab.

Lab4b.c:
	Source code to build lab4b. Lab4b is a program that runs on the Intel Edison. 
	It assumes that a button component is attached to D3 and that a temperature 
	sensor is attached to A0. Using the components, it reports the temperature
	after every period of time. If the button is pressed, the program exits. 
	Furthermore, while the program runs, it is able to read and process a number of 
	commands through standard input. These commands include SCALE=[C/F] to determine 
	whether it reports in Farenheits or Celcius, PERIOD=[NUMBER OF SECONDS] to determine what interval it reports
	at, STOP to stop the reporting, START to restart the reporting, and OFF to shut the program 
	off. 
	Furthermore, the user can pass arguments into the command to determine how it starts. 
	The program recognizes the following arguments:
		--scale=[SCALE_TYPE]	optional argument to change scale type to farenheit (F) or celcius (C)
		--period=[SECONDS]	optional argument to adjust wait time in seconds
		--log=[FILENAME]	optional argument to log temperature reports as well as commands to specified file
	***NOTE: The arguments to the program should be lowercase and the commands to the program should be uppercase.
	This can be confusing because the arguments and commands are very similar.
